              EggWorth was created to provide a fun and intuitive way to understand wealth and financial value. 
              By converting monetary values into something tangible like eggs, we can better grasp the scale of 
              different financial figures.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Our goal is to make financial concepts more accessible and engaging for everyone, from students 
              learning about economics to anyone curious about how their income compares to the wealthy.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Eggs are a nearly universal food item that most people buy regularly. They're relatively consistent 
              in size and quality, making them an interesting unit of measurement. Additionally:

              <li>Eggs have been consumed by humans for thousands of years</li>
              <li>Egg prices are tracked historically and vary with inflation</li>
              <li>Unlike currency, eggs represent a physical item of actual value</li>
              <li>Everyone can visualize what an egg looks like - making large numbers more comprehensible</li>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Our calculation is simple: we divide a monetary value by the current average price of a single egg.

                For example, if your annual income is $50,000 and an egg costs $0.25, your egg worth would be:

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Egg prices vary based on location, quality, and market conditions. For our calculations, we use
              an average price of $0.25 per egg, which approximates the U.S. national average for conventional eggs
              when purchased by the dozen.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Actual egg prices may differ based on your location, the time of year, and whether you're purchasing
              organic, free-range, or other specialty eggs.
